# README

## Overview
This folder provides a set of scripts for processing **patent** data in two steps:

1. **Data Extraction (extract.sh)**
   - Convert text files into JSONL format, ensuring that each line represents a single document.
   - Uses a blacklist file to exclude specified data.
2. **Data Filtering (filter.py)**
   - Remove unnecessary meta data text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/llm-jp/scripts.git
   cd scripts/corpus/llm-jp-corpus-v4/ja/patent
   ```
2. (Optional) Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tqdm
   ```

## Execution Steps
Run the scripts in the following order:

1. **Data Extraction:** (Convert text files to JSONL format)
   ```bash
   bash extract.sh
   ```
2. **Data Filtering:** (Extract data)
   ```bash
   python filter.py <input_dir> <output_dir> --worker <num_workers>
   ```

## Note
The filtering script `filter.py` does not support all data. It only processes a subset of the files extracted by `extract.sh`:
- `*-{A,B9,T,S,A5,APC,T5,U9,APD,ATC}.jsonl`.

Additionally, some other files were considered but do not contain any usable data, so they are not processed:
- `*-{UT,TG,APC,DG,IT,UTA,IR,TR,T_R1,ITA,T_T1}.jsonl`.

These supported files account for 99.5% of the total file size extracted by `extract.sh`.
